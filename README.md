# ruby packager(WIP)

This project is WIP. We hope to make this project a Gem in the future, but when we do, we may not be working on this repository.

This repository is a project to make any version of Ruby and any Ruby script into one binary.

# Usage

Basically, the `make` command is all you need to complete the process. Running `make` will generate a binary that combines the Ruby scripts under the `ruby_src/` directory with the Ruby generated in `dest_dir`.

The operation has been tested on M1 Linux and x86_64 Linux.


# TODO
- Enable cross-building
- Writing Tests
- Write documentation
- Implement options
